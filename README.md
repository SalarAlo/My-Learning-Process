Hello this is a repository for all of my projects i build and want to publish
<br>
A little bit about me:
<br>Im a 15 year old german programmer and my name is Salar <br>
I code in the languages c++ and c# and use qt and unity<br>
My favourite language is c++
<br> <br>
<hr>
I will publish files of these types:
<ul>
  <li>Videos of my projects</li>
  <li>Code of my projects</li>
  <li>Things i learned</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<br>
I created this repository on the 3rd of september 2023 <br>
and the main reason why i created this repository is so <br>
that when i apply for jobs or uni i can show them the <br>
progress i made over the years
<br>
